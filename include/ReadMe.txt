As a minimum requirement, add the SDK header files from the NatNet SDKs here (http://www.optitrack.com/products/natnet-sdk/).
- NatNetServer.h
- NatNetTypes.h

If you are using other motion capture systems, add their specific SDK header files as well.
- Cortex (MotionAnalysis > needs to be requested via email)
  - Cortex.h
